# This line ensures the main() 
# function is only called when this file is run directly; 
# it won't run if it's imported as a module. 
# It's considered the "pythonic" way to structure an executable program in Python. 
# Technically, the program will work fine by just calling main(), 
# but you might get an angry letter from Guido van Rossum if you don't.
